    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const arr2 = players.slice();
    console.log(arr2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const arr3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(arr3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const arr4 = [...players];
    console.log(arr4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    arr4[3]="Wes Bos";
    console.log(arr4);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social : {
        twitter : "@Coolman",
        facebook : "CoolDev"
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const per = Object.assign({},person,{number:90});
    per.age = 70;
    console.log(per);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const per2 = {...person};
    console.log(per2);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const per3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    per3.social.twitter = "Cooldude";
    console.log(per3,person);
